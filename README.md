Project Title: API Integration in Android Mobile Application

Description:
This project demonstrates how a mobile application integrates with a backend service using REST APIs.

The frontend is an Android application developed using Java and Android Studio. The backend is built using the Spring Framework following the MVC architecture and is deployed on Apache Tomcat.

The backend fetches cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko public API, stores it in a database to handle rate limiting and reliability, and exposes REST endpoints that return JSON responses.

The Android application consumes these APIs and displays the fetched data on the mobile interface. The project demonstrates a real-world client–server architecture commonly used in modern mobile applications.

Technology Stack:
- Android (Java)
- Spring Framework (Spring MVC)
- REST APIs
- MySQL (Database)
- Apache Tomcat
- CoinGecko Public API
